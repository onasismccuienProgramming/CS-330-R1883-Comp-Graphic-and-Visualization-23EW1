# How do I approach designing software
 #What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
   I have leaned what some of the definitions of openGL stand for.  I have been intruduced to shaders, buffers, lighting, coordinate positions
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to follow making each shape step by step.  Basically, I tried to incorporate cylinders, tryangles, and squares.
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Well, Once I fugure out where the 0,0 coordinate is located, I can then make the shape desired.  So I would just apply what I learned from the course.
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Well, the ones that I attempted to use, were the lighting.  I need to explore more practice tutorials, but I will get it eventually
# How did iteration factor into your development?
Well, basically I just tried to develop the shapes a little bit at a time.  For example, positioning the coordinates
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I still struggled with the cylinders.  I just could not figure out how to create multiple shapes in the same scene.
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It allowed me to get hands on with shaders, scenes, shapes, lighting, etc.  That will translate to having experinced the actual software
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Well, along with the C software, I can now apply basic shapes, and better understand how loops can be used with 3d scenes.
